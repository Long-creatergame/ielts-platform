        "title": "Passage 1 – Rethinking Feedback in Higher Education",
        "text": "Universities have long treated feedback as a simple, linear transaction: a teacher comments on a piece of work, the student reads those comments, and improvement follows. Yet research into student learning suggests that this account is, at best, incomplete. Feedback does not “work” merely because it exists; it works when learners are able to interpret it, accept it, and translate it into subsequent action. This process is influenced by factors that are not visible on a marked script: confidence, prior knowledge, the perceived credibility of the assessor, and even whether the student believes improvement is possible.\n\nOne widely discussed problem is timing. In many modules, students receive written feedback after an assignment has been graded and the topic has already shifted. Even when comments are thorough, their relevance can feel remote, as if they belong to a past version of the student’s learning. Some institutions have responded by speeding up marking, but a quicker return does not necessarily guarantee engagement. If students view feedback as a post-mortem rather than a resource for future work, they may skim it for the final grade and ignore the rest.\n\nA second issue concerns language. Academic feedback frequently contains compressed professional shorthand, such as “insufficient synthesis” or “weak criticality”. To an experienced academic, these phrases may be precise; to a student, they can be opaque. Moreover, feedback often includes multiple messages at once—praise, criticism, and suggested improvements—without signalling which points matter most. When overwhelmed, learners may default to what is easiest to do, such as correcting minor grammar errors, even if the assessor intended to highlight larger structural issues.\n\nIn response, some educators advocate “feedback literacy”: the capacity to understand feedback, make judgements about it, and use it strategically. This approach treats students not as passive recipients but as active participants. For example, learners can be asked to identify patterns in comments across several assignments, or to write a short action plan specifying how they will apply advice in a subsequent task. Peer review can also contribute, not because classmates are more accurate than instructors, but because reviewing others’ work can sharpen one’s sense of standards.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the burden should not fall entirely on students. If a course requires feedback literacy, then it must be taught explicitly. Otherwise, those who already possess academic cultural capital—students who are familiar with institutional expectations—will gain more than those who do not. Some universities have therefore experimented with dialogue-based feedback: short meetings, audio comments, or online exchanges in which the student can ask questions. The aim is not to remove challenge but to reduce misinterpretation.\n\nA further complication is emotional. Feedback threatens identity: it suggests that an individual’s current performance is inadequate. Even when comments are well-intentioned, students may interpret them as a judgement of ability rather than of a particular piece of work. Research has found that learners are more likely to act on feedback when it is framed as a set of choices—possible routes for development—rather than as a list of deficits. Yet achieving this tone consistently is difficult, especially in large classes.\n\nUltimately, the shift in thinking is subtle but significant: effective feedback is not an object delivered by teachers; it is a relationship between information and action. Universities that want students to benefit must design systems that support interpretation, prioritisation, and application—skills that can be learned, but rarely by accident.",

        "text": "As renewable electricity expands, the need to store energy at scale becomes pressing... (A) ... (B) ... (C) ... (D) ... (E) ... (F) ...\n\nA. As renewable electricity expands, the need to store energy at scale becomes pressing. The problem is not merely technical but systemic: wind farms and solar arrays generate power intermittently, while households and industries demand it continuously. For two decades, lithium-ion batteries have been the default answer, powering everything from phones to electric vehicles. Yet their dominance is now being questioned, partly because of the constraints of supply chains and partly because grid storage has different priorities than portable electronics.\n\nB. For grid applications, cost per kilowatt-hour, longevity, and safety often matter more than weight. This has revived interest in chemistries that were previously considered unfashionable. Sodium-ion batteries, for instance, replace lithium with sodium, a far more abundant element. While sodium cells generally have lower energy density, they can be adequate for stationary storage, where a battery’s mass is less critical. Manufacturers have also improved performance by optimising electrode materials that reduce the rapid degradation once associated with sodium designs.\n\nC. Another approach is the flow battery, which stores energy in liquid electrolytes kept in external tanks. Because the energy capacity depends largely on tank size, flow systems can be expanded more easily than conventional cells. Their architecture also separates power (the rate of charge and discharge) from capacity (how much energy is stored), allowing engineers to tailor installations to local needs. However, flow batteries can be expensive, and the chemicals used may be corrosive, requiring robust maintenance regimes.\n\nD. Meanwhile, researchers are exploring “solid-state” variants of existing batteries... prototypes often look promising in laboratories but struggle in real-world conditions.\n\nE. Beyond chemistry, there is the question of how storage integrates with the grid. Some analysts argue that focusing only on batteries is misguided. Demand-response programmes can shift consumption to times of high generation, reducing the amount of storage required...\n\nF. Still, the search for alternatives continues because no single technology can satisfy all scenarios. The most likely future is plural: a mix of storage systems...",

In particular, the use of printed textbooks and library loans declined steadily over the period, whereas online journals and recorded lectures became far more common.\n\nIn 2005, printed textbooks were the dominant resource, used by 82% of students, and over half (56%) also relied on borrowing physical items from the library. By 2015, both figures had fallen notably, to 64% and 38% respectively, indicating reduced dependence on printed and loaned materials even before 2025.\n\nBy contrast, digital resources rose sharply. The proportion using online academic journals increased from 34% in 2005 to 57% in 2015, reaching 76% by 2025, making it the most widely used resource at the end of the period. Recorded lectures showed the most dramatic growth, climbing from just 12% in 2005 to 46% in 2015 and then to 69% in 2025. By 2025, both digital options were used by a clear majority of students, while the two traditional resources were used by fewer than half."

      "prompt": "Some people believe that universities should require all students to complete a period of unpaid community work as part of their degree. Others argue that this would place an unfair burden on students.\n\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.",
      "modelAnswerBand7": "The idea of making unpaid community work compulsory for all university students is controversial. Supporters argue that it would benefit society and help students develop, while opponents contend that it could be unfair and impractical. This essay will discuss both perspectives before explaining why I believe community engagement should be strongly encouraged but not universally required.\n\nOn the one hand, compulsory service could produce clear social and educational gains. Universities do not exist in isolation; they are funded, directly or indirectly, by the wider public, and students may reasonably be expected to contribute in return. Community work can also cultivate transferable skills such as teamwork, communication and reliability, which are not always developed through academic study alone. Furthermore, structured placements may expose students to social issues beyond their campus experience, potentially making them more empathetic citizens and, in some fields such as education or health, more effective professionals.\n\nOn the other hand, a blanket requirement risks disadvantaging certain groups. Many students already juggle part-time jobs, caring responsibilities, or long commutes, and adding unpaid work could reduce their ability to support themselves financially. There is also the question of quality and oversight. If placements are introduced at scale, some students may be assigned tasks that are repetitive or poorly supervised, turning the requirement into a box-ticking exercise rather than meaningful service. Finally, students’ degrees vary considerably; imposing identical conditions on all programmes may ignore legitimate differences in workload and scheduling.\n\nIn my view, universities should provide well-designed opportunities and incentives for community work, but participation should remain flexible. For example, institutions could offer credit-bearing modules, paid placements for students with financial constraints, or alternative forms of contribution such as research support for local organisations. In this way, community engagement can be widened without becoming an unfair obligation."

I’d taken a lot of photos during a trip, and I realised they didn’t look as good as I expected—some were too dark, and the colours felt a bit flat. So I started watching short videos on how to adjust exposure, contrast and colour balance, and I practised on my own pictures as I went.\n\nAt first it was quite slow because I kept second-guessing myself—like, I’d change the brightness and then undo it because it looked unnatural. But after a few weeks I began to understand what “looks right”, especially for landscapes and portraits. I wanted to learn it mainly because I didn’t want my photos to just sit on my phone; I wanted them to look presentable, maybe even good enough to share.\n\nIt’s been useful in a couple of ways. Practically, I can now fix common issues very quickly, so I don’t waste time. And more broadly, it changed how I take photos in the first place, because I pay attention to light and composition. So it wasn’t only a technical skill; it improved my judgement as well."
