FINAL CORS SOLUTION - DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY
========================================

This is the ABSOLUTE FINAL fix for CORS issue.

Changes made:
1. Added CORS middleware directly to auth routes in auth.js
2. Added CORS middleware to /api/auth route in index.js
3. Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to *
4. Handle OPTIONS preflight requests properly

This MUST be deployed immediately to fix the CORS issue.

If this doesn't work, manual redeploy is REQUIRED on Render.
