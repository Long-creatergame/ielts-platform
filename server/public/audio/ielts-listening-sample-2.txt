# Library Information

Welcome to the university library. I'm Sarah, and I'll be showing you around today.

The library is open seven days a week. Our opening hours are Monday to Friday from 8 AM to 10 PM, and weekends from 9 AM to 6 PM. During exam periods, we extend our hours until midnight.

We have five floors in total. The ground floor contains the main desk, computer labs, and group study rooms. The first floor has the general collection and newspapers. The second floor is dedicated to science and technology books. The third floor houses the humanities section, and the fourth floor contains rare books and special collections.

To borrow books, you need your student ID card. You can borrow up to 15 books at a time for a period of two weeks. You can renew books online or by phone, but only if no one else has reserved them.

We also have an online database with access to thousands of academic journals and e-books. You can access this from anywhere on campus using your student login.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know about our services?
