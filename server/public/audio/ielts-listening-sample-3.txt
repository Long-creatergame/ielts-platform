# Job Interview

Good afternoon, Ms. Chen. Thank you for coming in today. I'm David from Human Resources, and this is my colleague, Lisa from the Marketing Department.

Let me start by asking you about your previous experience. I see you worked at ABC Company for two years. Could you tell us about your main responsibilities there?

That's very interesting. And what made you decide to leave that position?

Now, looking at this role, we're looking for someone who can manage our social media accounts and develop marketing campaigns. What experience do you have with social media marketing?

I see. And how do you stay updated with the latest trends in digital marketing?

Finally, where do you see yourself in five years' time?

Thank you for your time today, Ms. Chen. We'll be in touch within the next week to let you know our decision.
