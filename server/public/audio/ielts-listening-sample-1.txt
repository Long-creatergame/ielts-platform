# University Course Discussion

Good morning, everyone. Today we're going to discuss the course requirements for this semester. 

First, let me introduce myself. I'm Professor Johnson, and I'll be teaching this course on Environmental Science. The course is designed for second-year students who have completed the basic requirements.

Now, regarding the course structure, we have four main components. The first is lectures, which will be held every Tuesday and Thursday from 9 AM to 10:30 AM in Room 205. The second component is laboratory work, scheduled for Friday afternoons from 2 PM to 5 PM.

The third component is field trips. We'll have three field trips this semester. The first one is to the local nature reserve next week. The second trip is to the recycling center in mid-October. And the final trip is to the solar energy facility in November.

Finally, we have the assessment. There will be two written exams worth 40% each, and a final project worth 20%. The first exam is scheduled for October 15th, and the second exam is on December 3rd.

Any questions so far?
