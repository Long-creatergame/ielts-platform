============================

This is the ABSOLUTE FINAL fix for CORS issue in auth routes.

Changes made:

2. Added CORS middleware directly to auth routes in auth.js
3. Added CORS middleware to /api/auth route in index.js
4. Added CORS middleware to ALL routes with app.use('*')
5. Added FORCE CORS headers on every response
6. Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to *
