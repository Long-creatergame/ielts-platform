FORCE DEPLOY NOW - CORS STILL NOT FIXED
========================================

Render is still returning:
access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:5173

Instead of:
access-control-allow-origin: *

This means Render has NOT deployed the new CORS code yet.

URGENT: Manual redeploy required on Render dashboard!
