FORCE DEPLOY NOW - ABSOLUTE FINAL CORS FIX
This file forces Render to redeploy with the latest CORS fixes.

Changes made:
1. Updated server/index.js with absolute final CORS middleware
2. Updated server/package.json to ensure proper dependencies
3. Removed all conflicting CORS configurations
4. Simplified CORS middleware to use only res.setHeader()

This should finally fix the CORS issue once and for all.
