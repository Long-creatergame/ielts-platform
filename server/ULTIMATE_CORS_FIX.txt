ULTIMATE CORS FIX - FINAL SOLUTION
==================================

This is the ULTIMATE fix for CORS issue.

Changes made:
1. Added CORS middleware directly to auth routes in auth.js
2. Added CORS middleware to /api/auth route in index.js
3. Added CORS middleware to ALL routes with app.use('*')
4. Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to *
5. Handle OPTIONS preflight requests properly

This MUST be deployed immediately to fix the CORS issue.

If this doesn't work, manual redeploy is REQUIRED on Render.
