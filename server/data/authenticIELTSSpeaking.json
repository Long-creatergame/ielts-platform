        "sample_answer": "I'd like to talk about a memorable journey I took to Japan last summer with my family. We went to Tokyo and Kyoto for two weeks in July.\n\nWe traveled as a family of four - my parents, my younger sister, and myself. It was our first international trip together, which made it particularly special.\n\nWhat made this journey truly memorable was the incredible contrast between the two cities. Tokyo was absolutely fascinating with its futuristic technology, bustling streets, and amazing street food. We visited places like Shibuya Crossing, the Tokyo Skytree, and traditional temples hidden among modern buildings.\n\nKyoto, on the other hand, was like stepping back in time with its ancient temples, traditional gardens, and geisha districts. We stayed in a traditional ryokan and experienced authentic Japanese culture.\n\nThe journey was memorable because it opened my eyes to a completely different way of life and made me appreciate both technological advancement and cultural preservation. The Japanese people's respect for tradition while embracing innovation really inspired me. Also, trying authentic sushi, visiting a real tea ceremony, and seeing Mount Fuji were experiences I'll never forget.\n\nThis journey taught me the importance of experiencing different cultures and broadened my perspective on what's possible when tradition and innovation coexist harmoniously.",

        "sample_answer": "I'd like to talk about my high school mathematics teacher, Mrs. Nguyen, who has had a profound influence on my life and career choices.\n\nMrs. Nguyen was my math teacher for three years during high school, and she also served as the advisor for our school's mathematics club. She was in her early 40s and had been teaching for over 15 years when I met her.\n\nWhat made Mrs. Nguyen so influential was her unique teaching approach. Instead of just teaching formulas and procedures, she focused on helping us understand the logic and beauty behind mathematical concepts. She would often relate complex mathematical ideas to real-world problems, making abstract concepts tangible and relevant.\n\nShe also went beyond the curriculum, organizing extra classes for students interested in advanced mathematics and encouraging us to participate in national mathematics competitions. She spent countless hours after school helping students who were struggling, never making anyone feel inadequate.\n\nMrs. Nguyen influenced me because she showed me that mathematics isn't just about numbers and calculations - it's about problem-solving, logical thinking, and understanding patterns in the world around us. Her passion for the subject was contagious, and she helped me discover my own love for mathematics and logical reasoning.\n\nBecause of her influence, I decided to pursue Computer Science in university, as it combines mathematical thinking with practical applications. She taught me that with the right approach and dedication, any subject can become fascinating and accessible. Her belief in my potential gave me the confidence to pursue challenging academic goals.",

It's an iPhone that I use for multiple purposes throughout the day.\n\nI use my smartphone for various activities. Primarily, I use it for communication - calling, texting, and video chatting with family and friends, especially since I'm studying away from home. I also use it for academic purposes, such as taking notes, setting reminders for assignments, and accessing online learning materials and educational apps.\n\nAdditionally, I use it for navigation when I'm traveling to new places, for listening to music and podcasts during my commute, and for photography to capture important moments. I also use various productivity apps for time management and organization.\n\nWhat makes my smartphone particularly useful is its versatility and convenience. It combines multiple devices into one - a phone, camera, computer, GPS, music player, and more. This means I can carry everything I need in one compact device, which is especially important as a student who's always on the move.\n\nIt's also incredibly useful for staying connected with my studies and maintaining productivity. I can access my university's online platform, check emails, and even attend virtual classes when necessary. The ability to have all my important information and tools in one place has made my life much more organized and efficient.",

They should implement strict environmental laws and enforce them effectively, such as carbon taxes and emissions standards. Governments need to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and provide incentives for green technology adoption. They should also fund research and development for sustainable solutions and educate the public about environmental issues. International cooperation is essential, as environmental problems don't respect borders. Governments must work together on global agreements like the Paris Climate Accord and ensure compliance with environmental standards.",
