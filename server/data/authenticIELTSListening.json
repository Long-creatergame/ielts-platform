        "transcript": "Good morning, this is Sarah from the Student Accommodation Office. How can I help you today?\n\nStudent: Hi, I'm a new international student starting next semester. I'm looking for accommodation near the university campus.\n\nSarah: Welcome to our university! We have several accommodation options available. Let me tell you about our main options. First, we have on-campus dormitories, which are very popular with international students. The cost is £120 per week, and this includes all utilities and internet access.\n\nStudent: That sounds reasonable. What about the facilities?\n\nSarah: The dormitories have shared kitchens, common rooms, and laundry facilities. Each room has a single bed, desk, wardrobe, and private bathroom. We also have 24-hour security and maintenance support.\n\nStudent: Are there any other options?\n\nSarah: Yes, we also have off-campus shared houses. These are typically £80-100 per week, but you'd need to arrange your own internet and utilities. They're usually within a 15-minute walk of the campus.\n\nStudent: How do I apply for the dormitory?\n\nSarah: You can apply online through our website. The application deadline is the 15th of next month. You'll need to provide your student ID, passport copy, and a deposit of £200.\n\nStudent: Perfect, I'll apply today. Thank you for your help!\n\nSarah: You're welcome! Good luck with your studies!",

Sarah, could you tell us about your approach?\n\nSarah: I'm studying the impact of social media on student learning. I plan to conduct surveys with 200 undergraduate students and follow up with focus groups.\n\nProfessor: That's a good start, but you'll need to consider ethical approval. Have you submitted your ethics application yet?\n\nSarah: Yes, I submitted it last week. I'm waiting for the committee's response.\n\nProfessor: Good. Now, for your data analysis, I recommend using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The survey data will give you statistical insights, while the focus groups will provide deeper understanding of student experiences.\n\nSarah: I was thinking of using SPSS for the statistical analysis and thematic analysis for the qualitative data.\n\nProfessor: Excellent choices. Don't forget to consider potential limitations in your research. For example, your sample might not be representative of all students.\n\nSarah: I'm planning to use stratified sampling to ensure representation across different faculties and year groups.\n\nProfessor: That's a good strategy.

        "title": "Climate Change Lecture",
        "transcript": "Good afternoon, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the scientific evidence for climate change and its global implications.\n\nLet's start with the basic science. The Earth's climate has always changed naturally, but what we're seeing now is unprecedented in both speed and scale. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by over 40% since the Industrial Revolution, primarily due to human activities.\n\nThis increase in greenhouse gases has led to a global temperature rise of approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. While this might seem small, it has profound effects on weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems worldwide.\n\nLet's look at some specific impacts. Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate, with summer sea ice coverage decreasing by about 13% per decade. This not only affects polar ecosystems but also contributes to rising sea levels globally.\n\nIn terms of weather patterns, we're seeing more frequent and intense extreme weather events. Heatwaves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes are becoming more common and severe. These events have significant economic and social costs.\n\nThe scientific consensus is overwhelming. Over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change. This consensus is based on decades of research and multiple lines of evidence.\n\nHowever, addressing climate change requires global cooperation and immediate action. The window for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is rapidly closing, and we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45% by 2030 to have any chance of meeting this target.",
